# Development Rules and Guidelines

## Code Structure
1. All Python code should be in the `src` directory
2. Module-specific code should be in `src/modules`
3. Configuration files should be in their respective directories (supervisor/, etc.)

## Coding Standards
1. Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
2. Use type hints in Python functions
3. Document all functions and classes with docstrings
4. Keep functions focused and single-purpose
5. Use meaningful variable and function names

## FFmpeg Stream Configuration
1. Video settings:
   - Codec: h264
   - Resolution: 1920x1080
   - Framerate: 30 fps
   - Bitrate: adaptive

2. Audio settings:
   - Codec: aac
   - Sample rate: 44100 Hz
   - Channels: 2
   - Bitrate: 128k

## Container Guidelines
1. All services must be managed by Supervisor
2. Services must start in the correct order
3. Each service must have proper logging configured
4. Container must be x86_64 compatible

## Security Rules
1. No hardcoded credentials
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Minimize container privileges where possible
4. Keep dependencies updated

## Testing Requirements
1. Test stream stability
2. Monitor resource usage
3. Verify audio sync
4. Check browser compatibility

## Performance Guidelines
1. Optimize FFmpeg parameters for low latency
2. Monitor memory usage of Firefox
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use efficient stream buffering

## Documentation Requirements
1. Keep README.md updated
2. Document all configuration options
3. Maintain troubleshooting guide
4. Include setup instructions for different platforms

## Git Workflow
1. Use feature branches
2. Write meaningful commit messages
3. Review code before merging
4. Keep commits atomic and focused

## Monitoring
1. Implement health checks
2. Log important events
3. Monitor stream quality
4. Track resource usage
